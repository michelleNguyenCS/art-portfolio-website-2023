Program Description: A design sample of an art portfolio website containing my actual artwork.\
I was focusing more on responsive design and efficient ways of styling elements, so the appearance of the website might look a bit sloppy.\
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Some Concepts Studied:
- Multiple Webpages
- Navigating File Directories
- Internal and External Styles
- Responsive Design

Required Files for Website:
- icons/
- images/
- silkscreen-font/
- sprites/
- stylesheets/
- index.html         <!-- This is the homepage --/>
- ink_pencil.html
- paint.html
- other_media.html
- form.html
- sketch.js

One Way Run on Visual Studio Code (at least on my end):
- Live Server (Ritwick Dey) can be installed for the javascript animation to run, and you run the webpage through Visual Studio Code


Note:\
On "other_media.html" aka the "other media" webpage, the javascript file will start lagging the page if you let it run for too long.\
Just refresh the page after you're done looking at the animation and it'll be back to normal.
