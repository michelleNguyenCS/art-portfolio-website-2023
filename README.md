IDC4U1 - Grade 12 Web Development Project\
Creator: Michelle Nguyen\
Date of Completion: 2023-01-23\
Achieved Grade: 100%

Program Description: A design sample of an art portfolio website containing my actual artwork.\
I was focusing more on responsive design and efficient ways of styling elements rather than the appearance of the website.\
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Some Concepts Studied:
- Multiple Webpages
- Navigating File Directories
- Internal and External Styles
- Responsive Design

Required Files for Website:
- icons/
- images/
- silkscreen-font/
- sprites/
- stylesheets/
- index.html         <!-- This is the homepage -->
- ink_pencil.html
- paint.html
- other_media.html
- form.html
- sketch.js

To Run on Visual Studio Code:
- p5.vscode (Sam Lavigne) needs to be installed

Note:\
On "other_media.html" aka the "other media" webpage, the javascript file will start lagging the page if you let it run for too long.\
Just refresh the page after you're done looking at the animation and it'll be back to normal.
